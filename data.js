        "The mango tree is erect with a broad, rounded canopy which can attain 30-40 cm width and 20 m height. In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m, the profuse, wide-spreading, feeder root system also sends down many anchor roots which penetrate for several feet. The tree is long-lived, some specimens being known to be 300 years old and still fruiting. Nearly evergreen, alternate leaves are borne mainly in rosettes at the tips of the branches and numerous twigs from which they droop like ribbons on slender petioles. The new leaves are yellow, pink or wine-red, becoming dark-green and glossy above, lighter beneath. Each tree can produce hundreds and even as many as 3,000 to 4,000 small, yellowish or reddish flowers. There is great variation in the form, size, colour and quality of the fruits. They may be nearly round, oval or kidney-shaped. They range from 6 - 25 cm in length and can weigh from less than 200 g to 2 kg. The skin is leathery, waxy, smooth, thick and aromatic and the colour ranges from light-or dark-green to yellow, orange, reddish-pink to dark-red or purple. Some have a 'turpentine' odour and flavour, while others are richly and pleasantly fragrant. The flesh ranges from pale-yellow to deep-orange. Of the many hundreds of varieties of mangoes that grow in warm climates worldwide, the most popular in the UK are the Alphonso, Kesar and Sugar - all imported from the Asian sub-continent. Other popular varieties in the UK include Tommy Atkins, Keitt, Haden and Julie which are sold by supermarkets and generally look good but are tasteless as they have been picked too early.",

The leaves may be all green or variously striped with red, yellow or ivory down the middle or near the margins. At blooming time, the stem elongates and enlarges near the apex and puts forth a head of small purple or red flowers, each accompanied by a single red, yellowish or green bract. The stem continues to grow and acquires at its apex a compact tuft of stiff, short leaves called the 'crown' or 'top'. Occasionally a plant may bear 2 or 3 heads, or as many as 12 fused together, instead of the normal one.As individual fruits develop from the flowers they join together forming a cone shaped, compound, juicy, fleshy fruit to 30 cm in height, with the stem serving as the fibrous but fairly succulent core. The tough, waxy rind, made up of hexagonal units, may be dark-green, yellow, orange-yellow or reddish when the fruit is ripe. The flesh ranges from nearly white to yellow. If the flowers are pollinated, small, hard seeds may be present, but generally one finds only traces of undeveloped seeds.",

Suckers spring up around the main plant forming a clump or 'stool'', the eldest sucker replacing the main plant when it fruits and dies, this process of succession continues indefinitely. As the young fruits develop from the female flowers, they look like slender green fingers. The bracts are soon shed and the fully grown fruits in each cluster become a 'hand' of bananas, and the stalk droops with the weight until the bunch is upside down. The fruit (technically a 'berry') turns from deep-green to yellow or red and may range from 6-30 cm in length and 2-5 cm in width, and from oblong, cylindrical and blunt to pronouncedly 3-angled, somewhat curved and hornlike. The flesh, ivory-white to yellow may be firm, astringent, even gummy with latex, when unripe, turning tender, slippery and soft when ripe.",
